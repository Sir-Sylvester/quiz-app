## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Buid tool
- [TaiwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static type checking
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev//) - Test Runner


### What I learned
This project improved my skills in developing dynamic, user-friendly applications with modern web technologies. I mastered building a responsive quiz app using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. I enhanced my skills in creating flexible layouts, managing state, implementing keyboard navigation, and ensuring type safety with TypeScript, alongside using Vitest for testing. This experience solidified my ability to develop dynamic, user-friendly web applications.

### Continued development
I plan to expand my knowledge of accessibility best practices and further optimizing my TailwindCSS skills. I will deepen my understanding of TypeScript by tackling larger, more complex projects and also delve deeper into advanced React patterns and state management solutions.

### Useful resources
